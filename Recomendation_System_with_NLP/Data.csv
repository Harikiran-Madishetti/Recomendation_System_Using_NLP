""I look at how things can be done, not just how it is usually done.""

""I started B and E Enterprises 32 years ago, when I realized that no one else could do the kind of work I could. I had a passion to figure out how to make things that most people weren't able to make. Why can I make parts that other's can't? Because I look at prints and projects in a different way."" 

""Here at B and E Enterprises, we take great pride in attention to detail and making it right. Our superior production quality cannot be duplicated. We create products to the highest quality standards for our customers and we will maintain that same superior quality to produce your parts.""

Our history starts with only one wire EDM machine, a programming system and 150 sq. feet of electrical discharge machining services office space, Milton M. Thomas founded Wire Cut Company in November 1978. The demand for our electrical discharge services was overwhelming. In October of 1979, Wire Cut made its first move giving room for our first employee and the addition of a second electrical discharge machining services equipment. After incorporation in 1981, Wire Cut was up for a tough year in 1982. Although our sales growth was 35%, banks were telling us there was a recession and were reluctant to finance growth in such a young company. Wire Cut was too busy to participate in a recession that year. By 1983, we out grew our facilities and expanded down the street where we would stay for 13 years. Business continued to boom and by 1986 with 24 team members we had acquired a total of 10 wire More... EDM machining centers, 6 conventional EDMs and added machining to support our tooling. From 1987 to 1989, Wire Cut was busy with the expanding Aerospace electrical discharge machining industry. Our contracts with General Electric and other companies led the way to add more wire EDMs, high speed EDM drilling and CNC machining centers. Our employee count reached 34 and we had increased our leasing space to 8000 sq. ft.

Company Description by Globe Plastics, Inc.
Globe Plastics, Inc. was established on October 15, 1958 in Pomona, California by Roy and Marion Cramer. Roy was a retired engineer at General Dynamics. From that humble beginning Globe started a proprietary line of transistor pads that offered a low cost solution to problems associated with semi-conductor production handling and assembly. Globe manufactured its own tooling and became a leader in the electronics industry for many years. As the company's expertise grew in advanced engineering materials, Globe began compression and injection molding high strength composites for the aerospace/defense industry. In December, 1979, Globe purchased the Encapsulation Cup line from Polytop Corporation, located in Fullerton, CA. Then in 1982 Globe purchased the Encapsulation line from MG Precision Products of South El Monte, CA. Globe then had two proprietary lines consisting of thermoset and thermoplastic transistor pads and compression and transfer molded Encapsulation cups. In 1988 the company More... was acquired by entrepreneurs Nywood Wu and Clifton Chang to expand their existing base of defense based contract manufacturers. Being a minority owned composite molding firm, Globe was able to gain a larger share of the aerospace/defense industry. A position we still hold, 60 years later. In 1992, after the dramatic defense downturn, Globe began compression molding highly productive SMC and BMC materials to supply Globe Composites components for the sound and lighting industries. These materials and our processes proved to be far superior and a better value than existing thermoplastics and die cast aluminum components for the sound and lighting industries so Globe started penetrating these markets also. Since that time we have continued to expand our manufacturing capabilities, quality systems and process expertise. In 2004 we began a joint venture with Moldzen Precision in Dong Guan, China to form Globe Composites Far East where we have manufactured tooling for several years. We specialize in providing superior value in thermoset and thermoplastic molding of parts ranging in size from the head of a pin to a truck hood and anywhere in between. In 2008 Globe attained ISO 9001:2008 status and since then Globe has become AS 9100C certified firm and is listed on the Oasis database to give our customers and potential customers confidence relating to our quality, consistency and reliability.

It is these family values that drive us to develop and nurture positive business relationships with our customers, vendors, employees and the surrounding community.

Our primary area of expertise is the highly specialized process of Metal Spinning. In metal spinning, a flat metal disc is gradually forced by a roller onto a rotating mandrel, taking the shape of the mandrel. This combination of rotation and force shapes the blank into a cone, hemisphere, More... tube or other circular or cylindrical shape. Metal spinning remains extremely cost-effective today because it requires inexpensive tooling and can be applied to a wide variety of metals. CNC spin lathes are typically used for spinning large quantities, while, for smaller quantities, hand spinning remains. Less

The year was 1945 and using the tools and material of that time, Arnold Nickson began what was to become one of the outstanding operations of its kind in the West. The history of Nickson's Machine is like that of many successful businesses throughout the United States. 

Beginning in a small one-story structure, Nickson's made his beginning in what was to become an international business venture.

Having started in light and heavy automotive machine work, Nickson's became more involved in heavy oilfield machine work. The early 1950s were a time of steady industrial growth, and the nation's search for oil was in full swing. 

This provided an opportunity for Nickson's to diversify and grow with the booming petroleum industry which served as a source of business along with the supply of engines and replacement parts. From the outset, Nickson's began to build a reputation for quality products and efficient, dependable service.

Today, with an additional base for a larger, more diversified operation, More... Nickson's Machine now occupies a 23,000-square-foot plant in an easily accessible part of Santa Maria. This consolidated, well-equipped shop has continued to be a leader in complete engine machining, with general machine shop capabilities and a complete full service parts department. Always looking to the future for new and challenging opportunities, Nickson's present capabilities have grown significantly to include the design and manufacturing of large pump and gas compressor systems vital to the burgeoning oil and refinery business.

Company Description by Advance Carbon Products, Inc.
We have complete machining facilities to supply you with the size and shape of anodes, bushings and seals, contacts, brush holders and carbon brushes that you require.

Carbon Brush quantities are manufactured from one to 100,000 per order, on a made-to-order basis. We stock more than 50,000 brushes for the popular brands of U.S. and some foreign equipment. In stock brushes can be shipped the same day the order is received. 

We can machine graphite heaters, anodes, boats, molds and crucibles, using computer programs that are done in house. Items of a simpler design are usually machined using conventional equipment.

Advance Carbon Products was founded in 1956, as Advance Carbon & Electric Mfg. (ACEM), with the original facility located in a small shop in San Francisco. After successfully producing carbon brushes and mechanical graphite products for several markets, ACEM was reorganized into two different companies in 1962, one being Advance Carbon Products, Inc. (ACP) In 1966 Advance Carbon More... Products was purchased from the parent company by the management team which included one of its original founders, William J. Crader, Jr.

 ACP is one of the few carbon manufacturing companies producing a complete line of carbon products. We have machine shop facilities to manufacture carbon brushes as small as .060"" square, to segmented seal rings as large as 12 ft in diameter. Among many other items, our shop equipment consists of conventional and CNC lathes and mills, grinders, lappers, and diamond saws. Less

Company Description by Boecking Machining
Since 1990 Boecking Machining has been a high-tech CNC machining company with state-of-the art equipment.

With the development of Computer Aided Design software in the late eighties, mechanical designers had the ability to design more complex parts. Customers soon discovered that the current supply base of machine shops were unable to manufacture parts to the new complex/tolerances.

In 1990 Boecking Machining was founded to fill this niche, by providing complex quality parts, on-time and at a reasonable price.

Thus, the slogan ""Hot Tuff Jobs"" was born.

Boecking Machining has assisted designers and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with high quality products, dependable service and on-time deliveries.

Company Description by Scalar Manufacturing
Scalar Manufacturing is a manufacturing company unlike any other.

Our mission is to make quality, technology, and low cost accessible at any volume.

Get your one specialty component made or consolidate your entire supply chain into one company by working with Scalar Manufacturing. You receive the flexibility and ease of a small firm but the manufacturing strength of a large company. Scalar Manufacturing gives its customers the simplicity of a one-stop shop and the low cost of separately sourcing each component, but without the costs associated with vertical integration.

Originally a printed circuit board and semiconductor packaging firm, Scalar Manufacturing added injection molding, die casting, and metal stamping to build housings for assembled PCBs. The last step is then to put everything together, and so Scalar Manufacturing offers cable assembly, electro-mechanical assembly, and finished product assembly. Due to the high overhead of many traditional processes, 3D Printing serves as More... a rapid prototyping service.

 Since we are primarily a manufacturer's representative, our products and services integrate seamlessly, but there is no associated overhead and thus no added cost. We can manufacture in volumes as low as 1, while our principals are capable of over 1 million pieces per month. Products are as simple as a bottlecap, or as complicated as a mobile device - PCB, housing manufacture, and final assembly. Less
